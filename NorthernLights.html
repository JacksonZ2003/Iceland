                    <i>THE OTHERWORDLY AURORA borealis</i>, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere-at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 
                    miles-when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is colorful, dancing light show.

                The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows 
                yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55Â° and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude 
                on NOAA and here.

                In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, 
                the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are 
                pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find then dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
